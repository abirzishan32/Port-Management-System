**Port Management System**:

The Port Management System is a C++ program that helps you manage different types of ships in various ports. It allows you to add and remove ships from ports and provides information about the ports and their ships.

**Features**:
*Port Management*: The code allows you to manage different types of ports, including Container Ports, Cruise Ports, Fishing Ports, Ferry Ports, Tanker Ports, Military Ports, and Cargo Ports.

*Ship Management*: You can add and remove ships from ports based on their respective types. This helps in organizing and tracking ships in the ports effectively.

*Port Information*: The program provides detailed information about each port, including its name, capacity, location, and the number of ships present. This feature allows users to access important data about the ports easily.

*User-Friendly Interface*: The code offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface that guides users through the process of interacting with the Port Management System. It provides clear on-screen instructions for seamless usage.

*File I/O*: The program includes a file input/output functionality that enables saving port data to a file named port_data.txt. This feature ensures data persistence and allows for future retrieval and analysis.

*Object-Oriented Design*: The code follows an object-oriented design approach, utilizing classes such as Ship, Port, and specific port type classes like ContainerPort, CruisePort, etc. This design enhances code organization, modularity, and reusability.

**OOP features used for implementation**:

1. Class
2. Nested function
3. Abstraction

13. Many more

**How To Operate This Code**:

*1. Installation:*
a. Download the code files to your local machine or clone the repository.
b. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code files are located.

*2. Running the Code:*
The program will start and display the main menu on the screen.

*3. Main Menu:*
a. The main menu presents a list of available options. Each option is assigned a number.
b. To select an option, enter the corresponding number and press Enter.
c. The available options typically include:
  i) Add a Port: Allows you to add a new port to the system.
  ii) Remove a Port: Lets you remove an existing port from the system.
  iii) Add a Ship: Allows you to add a ship to a specific port.
  iv) Remove a Ship: Lets you remove a ship from a specific port.
  v) View Port Information: Displays detailed information about a specific port.
  vi) View All Ports: Shows a list of all ports in the system.
  vii) Save Data: Saves the port data to a file for future retrieval.
  viii) Exit: Terminates the program.
  
*4. Interacting with the System:*
a. Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the system.
b. Enter the required information when prompted, such as port name, ship details, or port selection.
c. To go back to the main menu at any time, type 'back' or select the appropriate option if available.
d. Utilize the options to manage ports, add or remove ships, view port information, and perform other operations as needed.

**5. File I/O:**
a. The system provides the option to save port data to a file (e.g., port_data.txt).
b. This file can be used to load previously saved port data when running the system in the future.
